# About
Got busy with real life stuff and had to put this release on hold. Unfortunately in that time I lost the code for the fortnite replay reader (thanks again to Shiqan for creating that program) portion of this program. If I get back around to this project, all that I converted his program into doing was to create a "ConsoleReader.exe" which would read the game file and output the list of players to playerList.json in a format that I had chosen. I'll recreate this portion of the program if necessary or people request for it or the program starts crashing for everyone and I want to diagnose and patch things up. Along with that the code for "get-exchange-code.exe" (source from ThisNils) is also gone, but all that did was generate an exchange code which was passed to the python portion of the program to use when connecting to Epic Servers. This is most likely gonna be the break point for this program since Epic likes to mess around and I'll have to re-automate the process of getting an exchange code, but I'll get to that when I need to and release the source for it.

There's no auto update in this program, don't plan on forcing that in either, if I make an update, the program alerts you on boot that there's a new release and you can come back here to download it.

**Yes, this is the same program that SypherPK was using to catch Stream Snipers, I know it got him to ban at least 1 person, so, I'm happy with it overall.**
