# About
Fixed up the project and releasing the code, the only code that I've lost since I last worked on this project in June-ish (currently November) is the code for the FortniteReplayDecompressor program. All that did was parse the replay and output a file called playerList.json and you can check out their API at https://github.com/Shiqan/FortniteReplayDecompressor and find the json structure at the bottom of main.py.

There's no auto update in this program, don't plan on forcing that in either, if I make an update, the program alerts you on boot that there's a new release and you can come back here to download it.

**Yes, this is the same program that SypherPK was using to catch Stream Snipers, I know it got him to ban at least 1 person, so, I'm happy with it overall.**
