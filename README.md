Got busy with real life stuff and had to put this release on hold. Unfortunately in that time I lost the code for the fortnite replay reader (thanks again to Shiqan for creating that program) portion of this program. If I get back around to this project, all that I converted his program into doing was to create a ConsoleReader.exe which would read the game file and output the list of players to playerList.json in a format that I had chosen. I'll recreate this portion of the program if necessary or people request for it or the program starts crashing for everyone and I want to diagnose and patch things up.

There's no auto update in this program, don't plan on forcing that in either, if I make an update, the program alerts you on boot that there's a new release and you can come back here to download it.

Download using the following link for now, instructions will be inside a file called README.txt

You can also watch this tutorial to help you install/setup the program

If you like the program that I've made, you can send a tip at the following link (THE PROGRAM ITSELF IS FREE, if you paid for it, refund and call the scammer out).

Yes, this is the same program that SypherPK was using to catch Stream Snipers, I know it got him to ban at least 1 person, so, I'm happy with it overall.
