# About
This is a tool intended for famous Fortnite streamers who get stream sniped during their games and want to have some sort of preventative measure to make tracking and reporting easier against their stream snipers. This project couldn't have been done without the use of the Fortnite replay reading API developed by Shiqan (can be found here https://github.com/Shiqan/FortniteReplayDecompressor) .

There's no auto update in this program, don't plan on forcing that in either, if I make an update, the program alerts you on boot that there's a new release and you can come back here to download it.

**Yes, this is the same program that SypherPK was using to catch Stream Snipers, I know it got him to ban at least 1 person, so, I'm happy with it overall.**

# Download

Download the progrm from the releases page, you only need to get **SniperHunter.zip**, instructions will be inside a file called README.txt

# Disclaimer
This program doesn't tamper with your Fortnite gameplay in anyway, I'm not assocaited with Epic Games, I made this software for educational purposes and to catch stream snipers.

All this program does, is open your replay file (AFTER you've finished a game), read the replay and extracts the relevant information. This information is then parsed and organized by my program and displayed in a user-friendly format.

It's like going into your replay through Fortnite, writing down everyones name yourself, and then figuring out who's name has occured more than once; except much faster, and additional features.
