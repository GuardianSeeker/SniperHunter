# About
This is a tool intended for famous Fortnite streamers who get stream sniped during their games and want to have some sort of preventative measure to make tracking and reporting easier against their stream snipers.

There's no auto update in this program, don't plan on forcing that in either, you can check for an update through the About page in the program or check here occasionally.

**Yes, this is the same program that SypherPK was using to catch Stream Snipers in it's earliest stages and was able to leverage it successfully.**

# Download

Download the progrm from the releases page, you only need to get **SniperHunter.zip**, extract it to a folder anywhere and run **Sniper Hunter.exe**.

https://github.com/GuardianSeeker/SniperHunter/releases/latest/

# Install Tutorial

Download the latest version of the program.

Extract to a folder anywhere.

Run **Sniper Hunter.exe** (a shortcut on your desktop/etc would be useful)

As of version 3.4, you will need to have .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime installed in order to get the replay parser to work.

# Update Tutorial

When updating the program, just copy your database.db file in the old Sniper Hunter folder out, and place it in the folder of the newest version of the program.

# Disclaimer
This program doesn't tamper with your Fortnite gameplay in anyway, I'm not assocaited with Epic Games, I made this software for educational purposes and to catch stream snipers.

All this program does, is read your replay file (AFTER you've finished a game), read the replay data and extracts the relevant information. This information is then parsed and organized by my program and displayed in a user-friendly format.
